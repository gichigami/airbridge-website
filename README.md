## Deployment

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)

The website can be deployed to any static hosting service:

#### GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all files from the `website/` directory
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages
4. Select the branch and folder (usually `main` and `/root`)
5. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

#### Netlify
1. Sign up at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop the `website` folder to Netlify's deploy area
3. Your site will be automatically deployed with a free `.netlify.app` domain
4. Optionally configure a custom domain

#### Vercel
1. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://www.vercel.com)
2. Import your project (if using Git) or upload the folder
3. Deploy with zero configuration
4. Your site will be available instantly

#### AWS S3 + CloudFront
1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Upload all files from the `website/` directory
3. Enable static website hosting in bucket properties
4. Configure CloudFront distribution for better performance (optional)
5. Set bucket policy for public read access

#### AWS Amplify
1. Connect your repository or upload files
2. Amplify will automatically detect the static site
3. Configure build settings (usually no build step needed)
4. Deploy and access via provided URL

### Option 2: Traditional Web Server

Upload all files to any web server via FTP/SFTP:

1. Upload `index.html` to the root directory (or subdirectory)
2. Ensure `css/` and `js/` directories maintain their structure
3. Set proper file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
4. Access via your domain

## Contact Form Configuration

The contact form currently includes client-side validation only. To enable form submission, you'll need to configure one of the following:

### Option 1: Backend API Endpoint
1. Create a backend API endpoint to handle form submissions
2. Update the form submission handler in `js/script.js`
3. Add an AJAX request to send form data to your API

### Option 2: Third-Party Service
1. Use services like:
   - Formspree
   - EmailJS
   - Netlify Forms (if deploying on Netlify)
   - AWS SES (for serverless email)
2. Follow the service's integration instructions
3. Update the form action or JavaScript accordingly

### Option 3: Mailto Fallback (Temporary)
For a simple temporary solution, you can uncomment the mailto link in `js/script.js`:

```javascript
// Uncomment in the showSuccessMessage function:
const mailtoLink = `mailto:gjohnson@pioneer-aero.com?subject=AirBridge Inquiry from ${encodeURIComponent(name)}&body=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
window.location.href = mailtoLink;
```

## Customization

### Colors
Edit CSS variables in `css/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;
    --secondary-color: #06b6d4;
    /* ... other variables ... */
}
```
